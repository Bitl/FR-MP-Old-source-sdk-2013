FIREFIGHT RELOADED is a (now open source) Source SDK 2013 modification with the goal to combine gameplay elements from Half-Life 2, SMOD, old-school first-person shooters like Quake and Unreal Tournament, and the RPG-styled horde-mode gameplay that ties this mod together.

This repo contains the old MP client used in older versions of FIREFIGHT RELOADED.
